\noindent {{\bf Limitations and Threats to Validity}}. First, {\tool} did not handle the code with multiple \code{try-catch}
blocks. Second, it cannot generate new exception types that were not
in the training corpus. Third, it does not support the generation of
exception handling code inside the body of \code{catch}. Finally,
{\tool} needs training data, thus, does not work for a new library
without any API usage~yet.

Our solution is specifically for Java. Our collected data might not be
representative. However, we use well-established open-source projects with
well-known libraries.
