\subsubsection*{\bf Limitations and Threats to Validity}
%First, {\tool} can not handle the code with multiple \code{try-catch}
%blocks.
First, {\tool} cannot generate new exception types that were not in
the training corpus. Second, it does not support the generation of
exception handling code inside the \code{catch} body. Third, {\tool}
needs training data, thus, does not work for a new library without any
API usage~yet. {\tool} is specifically for Java. Our collected data
might not be representative. However, we use well-established projects
and libraries. FuzzyCatch~\cite{xrank-fse20} does not
suggest \code{try}-block statements and exceptions, thus, we compared
only with XRank (part of FuzzyCatch).
