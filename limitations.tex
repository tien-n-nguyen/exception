\noindent {{\bf Limitations and Threats to Validity}}.
First, {\tool} can not handle the code with multiple \code{try-catch}
blocks. Second, it cannot generate new exception types that were not
in the training corpus. Third, it does not support the generation of
exception handling code inside the body of \code{catch}. Fourth,
{\tool} needs training data, thus, does not work for a new library
without any API usage~yet. Our solution is specifically for Java. Our
collected data might not be representative. However, we use
well-established projects with well-known
libraries. FuzzyCatch~\cite{xrank-fse20} does not suggest statements
and exception types. Thus, we compared only with XRank.
