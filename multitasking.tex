\section{Multi-task Learning}
\label{sec:multitasking}

Learning on the three tasks, {\xblock}, {\xstate}, and {\xtype}
can benefit to one another. If a model decides the need
of a \code{try-catch} block, there must be some statements in the code
snippet that will be placed in such a block. If a model learns the
statements to be placed in a \code{try-catch} block, it can decide
that the code snippet needs such a block and make the connections to
what exception types to be caught. The knowledge on the exception
types can help a model decide better what important statements need to
be in a \code{try-catch} block. Thus, we put the three tasks
in a multi-task learning fashion.

%The two tasks dealt with by {\xstate} and {\xtype} can benefit each other. With the learning about which statements need to be put into try blocks, the model will learn the important code tokens in the code snippet, which in turn will help to determine which exceptions need to be handled. Also, knowing the exceptions will give strong hint to the way that statements should be grouped into try blocks.

We calculate the training loss by combining the losses from the three
modules. $Loss_{{\xblock}}$ is the Binary Cross Entropy loss for the
decision as to whether \code{try-catch} blocks exist in the input. To
calculate $Loss_{{\xstate}}$, we first get the classification loss for
each statement ($loss_{Stmt}$) in the input, and add them
together. $loss_{Stmt}$ is the Cross Entropy loss calculated from the
distribution for the three tags -- \code{O}, \code{B-Try},
\code{I-Try} -- and the ground-truth tag. Finally, in \xtype, several
\code{try-catch} blocks might be present, so $Loss_{{\xtype}}$ comes
from the summation of the exception prediction losses from all the
\code{try-catch} blocks. For each \code{try-catch} block, the
$loss_{try-block}$ is calculated by adding the Binary Cross Entropy
loss for the prediction of each exception that we considered.

The overall training loss is calculated as follows. If the input does
not contain any \code{try-catch} block, the loss will be only 
$Loss_{{\xblock}}$. If the input contains a \code{try-catch} block,
the overall loss will be the summation of the losses from all
three tasks:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:loss}
Loss_{overall} =
\begin{cases}
Loss_{{\xblock}},  & \text{no try-catch}\\
Loss_{{\xblock}} + Loss_{{\xstate}} + Loss_{{\xtype}}, &\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
