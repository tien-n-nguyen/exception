\section{{\xtype}: Multitask Learning}
\label{sec:multitasking}

{\xstate} and {\xtype} are two tasks that benefit each other. The learning about which statements need to be put into try blocks is important in that it will also learn 
the important code tokens in the code snippet, which in turn will help to determine which exceptions need
to be handled. Also, knowing which exceptions need to be handled will help to determine which statements need to be in that try block.

During training, we combine losses from the three modules.
