{\color{red}{N1-N10 are the number of nodes that the subgraph contains which means the size of the try-catch block. Because the average size of the try-catch is 5.7, I currently pick 6 as the size of the try-catch block. The accuracy here is defined as: if a statement is in the try-catch block and our model put it in the subgraph, I regard it is correct $S_c$. All other conditions, I think they are incorrect. If there are $S$ statements in the try-catch block, the total accuracy is calculated as $S_c/S$}}
