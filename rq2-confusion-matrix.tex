To further understand their decision making, we show the confusion matrices for both {\xstate} and the Codebert baseline model. In Figure~\ref{fig:rq2-cm-xstate}, we see {\xstate} has high confidence in predicting statements that are outside try blocks; however, it more often conflates try-block statements with non-try-block statements. Figure~\ref{fig:rq2-cm-codebert} explains why the Codebert baseline model fails the task: It assign the \code{I-Try} label to all the statements. And without the \code{B-Try} label, \code{I-Try} can never be interpreted as a valid try block.
