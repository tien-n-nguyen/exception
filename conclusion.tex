\section{Conclusion}

{\tool} is the first neural network approach to automated exception
handling recommendation in three tasks for both complete as well as
partial code. It is designed to capture the basic insights to overcome
key limitations of the state-of-the-art IR approaches. With the
learning-based approach, it does not rely on a pre-defined threshold
for explicit feature matching. The dependencies and context help
{\tool} learn the identities of API elements to avoid name ambiguity
and to learn the connections between them and the corresponding
exception types. Our empirical evaluation shows that {\tool} improves
over the state-of-the-art approaches in both intrinsic task and
extrinsic one in exception-related bug detection.
