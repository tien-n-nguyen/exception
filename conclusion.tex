\section{Conclusion}

{\tool} is the first neural-network model to automated exception
handling recommendation in three tasks for (in)complete code. It is
designed to capture the basic insights to overcome key limitations of
the state-of-the-art IR approaches. With the learning-based approach,
it does not rely on a pre-defined threshold for explicit feature
matching. Our empirical evaluation shows that the dependencies and
context help {\tool} learn the identities of API elements to avoid
name ambiguity and to learn their relations with the exception
types. Our results also demonstrate that {\tool} improves over the
state-of-the-art approaches in both intrinsic task and extrinsic one
in exception-related bug detection.
