\subsection{Research Questions}

%We conducted several experiments to evaluate {\tool}.
To evaluate {\tool}, we seek to answer the following questions:

\vspace{2pt}
%\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1}. [Effectiveness on Java code]
%  (Intrinsic Evaluation).} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in generating
%  CFG/PDGs for Java code in general and in different dependency
%  types?}

\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1}. [{\xblock}'s Effectiveness on \code{Try-Catch}
    Necessity Checking]} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in predicting
  whether a given code snippet needs to have a \code{try-catch}
  block?}
    
%            program-dependency edges generated by \tool for Java code?
%            How accurately does \tool predict different types of
%            control-flow and program-dependency edges for Java code?}


\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{2}. [{\xstate}'s Effectiveness on \code{Try-Block}
    Statement Detection].} {\em How accurate is {\tool} in predicting
  which statements in a given code snippet need to be placed in a
  \code{try} block?}

%\vspace{2pt}
%\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{4}. [Ablation Study on C/C++
%    code].}  {\em How do the different components in \tool contribute to
%  model performance?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{3}. [{\xtype}'s Effectiveness on Exception Type Recommendation].}
{\em How accurate is {\tool} in recommending what exception types need to be handled in the \code{catch} clause of a \code{try-catch} block?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{4}. [Statement Dependency Probing].}
{\em How well {\tool} learn the statement dependencies for grouping them into a \code{try} block?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{5}. [Usefulness on
    Exception-related Bug Detection].}  {\em How well does {\tool}
  detect exception-related bugs?}

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{6}. [Ablation Study].} {\em How does
 fine-tuning improve {\tool}?}
