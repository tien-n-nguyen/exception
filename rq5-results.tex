%{\color{red}{This section waiting for the XRank Results. But from the current estimate, our approach should have higher F-score. But the recall and precision I'm not sure. Once I have the results, I will update this section.}}

Table~\ref{tab:bug} displays the comparison result. As seen, {\tool}
can be used to detect well real-world exception-related bugs in which
the code snippet needs but did not have the \code{try-catch} blocks or
miss some exceptions. In comparison, {\tool} improves over the
state-of-the-art FuzzyCatch, an IR approach, {\bf XX\%} in Precision,
{\bf YY\%} in Recall, and {\bf ZZ\%} in F-score. The examples of buggy
code and fixes with the addition of \code{try-catch} blocks are
available at FuzzyCatch's code repository: ebrand.ly/ExDataset.
