As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rq4-density}, the distribution in terms of cosine distances for all the inside-to-outside statement pairs is largely to the right of the distribution for all the inside statement pairs, showing that {\tool} tends to encode statements in a way that statements in the same try block are closer to each other in the embedding space. To calculate the confidence interval, we take
