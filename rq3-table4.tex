\subsubsection{Performance of {\tool} ({\xblock}+{\xstate}+{\xtype})}

As seen in Table~\ref{tab:xtype-4}, {\em {\tool} as evaluated as three
  components, achieves 95.9\%, 45.1\%, and 61.3\%} in Precision,
Recall, and F1-score, respectively. In almost 96\% of the predictions,
it correctly decides the need of the \code{try-catch} block, the
number of blocks and respective statements, and the exception types
in the \code{catch} clauses. {\tool} covers 45.1\% of the exception
types, resulting a F1-score of 61.3\%.
%
Comparing with Table~\ref{tab:xtype-1}, the numbers are lower due
to the impacts from \xblock and \xstate. In total,
{\tool} predicts {\em correctly in all three tasks for 22,010 out of
  30,764 total instances (71.5\%)} in GitHub dataset. Among 15,328
positive samples, {\em {\tool} predicts correctly 6,928 positive
  instances (45\%) in all three tasks}. Moreover, the higher
performance of {\xblock}+{\xstate}+{\xtype} over the multiplication of
individual component's accuracy indicates the benefit of our
multi-tasking.

  %three prediction tasks: {\xblock}, {\xstate}, and {\xtype}}.
