As seen in Table~\ref{tab:xtype-4}, {\bf {\tool} as evaluated as three
  components, achieves 95.9\%, 45.1\%, and 61.3\%} in Precision,
Recall, and F1-score, respectively. In almost 96\% of the predictions,
{\tool} correctly decides the need of the \code{try-catch} block, the
number of blocks and corresponding statements, and the exception types
in the \code{catch} clauses. {\tool} covers 45.1\% of the exception
types, resulting a F1-score of 61.3\%. Comparing with
Table~\ref{tab:xtype-1}, the numbers are lower because it has impacts
of the results from \xblock and \xstate. In total, {\tool} predicts
{\bf correctly in all three tasks for 22,010 out of 30,764 total
  instances (71.5\%)} in Github dataset. Among 15,328 positive
samples, {\bf {\tool} predicts correctly 6,928 positive instances
  (45\%) in all three tasks}.
