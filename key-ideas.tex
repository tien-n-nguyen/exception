\subsection{Key Ideas}
\label{key:sec}

\noindent We design {\tool} for exception handling recommendation for
Java code: 1) given a code snippet, it will point out which statements
in the snippet need to be placed within a \code{try-catch} block, and
what exceptions need to be handled in the catch clause. Following
Observations 1-5, we design {\tool} with the following key ideas:

%\subsubsection*{{\bf [Key Idea 1] Neural Network-Based Approach to Partial Program Dependence Analysis}}
Instead of deterministically deriving the exceptions to be handled for
a given (incomplete) code snippet, following Observation 2, we design
a deep learning model (DL) to learn to analyze that snippet to
recommend the statements to be placed within the \code{try-catch}
block and to recommend the exceptions in the \code{catch} clause.  By
leveraging the \code{try-catch} blocks of the complete code in the
open-source projects (e.g., GitHub) in the training process, our DL
model can help the adaptation in two tasks: 1) deciding what
statements in the given code snippet to be placed in a
\code{try-catch} block, and 2) deciding what exceptions to be handled.

\subsubsection{{\bf [Key Idea 2] Leveraging Context to Avoid
Ambiguity and Learning the Connections between API elements and
Exception Types}} Instead of learning only the associations between an
API element and exception types, we leverage as the context the
complete methods in the code corpus for training, which are parseable
and provide us the identities (i.e., FQNs) of the API elements. Our DL
model will also leverage the context to learn the connections between
the key API elements in the context and the exception types that need
to be caught.

We seek inspiration from the neural network-based span-based ...
approaches~\cite{?} in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They
successfully learn ... Following suit, we design \tool to learn the
representations for the statements in source code so as to learn the
